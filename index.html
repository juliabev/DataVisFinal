            and mental health self-reported ratings.

            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) has come along way since it was first created
            (HTML 1.0 - 1993). These days, we usually define content
            in HTML, and define the style/layout of the content in
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

            This block was styled directly in the HTML.
