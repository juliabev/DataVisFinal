        Julia made the correlation heat map, the "Favorite genre vs Hours listened to music per day" boxplot, and she was in charge of creating and editing the repository.
        Molly made  "Primary Streaming Service by Age", "The Effect of Age on Hours Listened per Day", the age counts graph, and the 3 Anxiety vs Mental Health Illnesses graphs.
        Shreshtha made the "Anxiety rankings given age and hours listened per day", "Mental Health Ranking Distribution (Instrumentalists vs. Non-Instrumentalists and Composers vs. Non-Composers)", and "Relation between MH condition and Genre Frequency"
