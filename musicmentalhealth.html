        <h1>Music and its effects on Mental Health</h1>
        <h2>Overarching Question</h2>
        <p>
        How does music impact mental health?
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            As studies have been conducted, it has been shown that music not only shapes individual and cultural identities, but also plays a strong role in mood regulation and improvement of mental health. As students, music plays a large role in our lives whether that’s for studying, being active, or hanging out with friends. With the rise of technology, it is especially easier to quantify one’s music statistics, meaning people can report exactly how often they listen to music or exactly what genres they are listening to. Some of our inspiration comes from Spotify Wrapped, a marketing campaign about individual user’s activity over the past year. Seeing how music habits differentiate from person to person motivated us to understand if those habits have any effect on mental health or something greater. We hope to take advantage of the increase in available music streaming data to know in what specific ways listening to music has helped us and what further steps people can take to maximize their potential benefit. To do this, we want to look at how variables such as hours spent listening to music, genres listened to, and context in which the music is listened to can improve disorders such as Anxiety, Depression, and more.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
            During a coin toss, the coin is thrown into the air such that it rotates edge-over-edge several times. Either beforehand or when the coin is in the air, an interested party calls "heads" or "tails", indicating which side of the coin that party is choosing. The other party is assigned the opposite side. Depending on custom, the coin may be caught; caught and inverted; or allowed to land on the ground. When the coin comes to rest, the toss is complete and the party who called correctly or was assigned the upper side is declared the winner.

            It is possible for a coin to land on its side, usually by landing up against an object (such as a shoe) or by getting stuck in the ground. However, even on a flat surface it is possible for a coin to land on its edge. A computational model suggests that the chance of a coin landing on its edge and staying there is about 1 in 6000 for an American nickel.[3] Angular momentum typically prevents most coins from landing on their edges unsupported if flipped. Such cases in which a coin does land on its edge are exceptionally rare and in most cases the coin is simply re-flipped.[4] It may occur that the toss is affected by unintentional means such as not landing on a flat surface, landing up against an object (such as a shoe) or making contact with a hand in free fall. In cases where such things occur the coin is to be re tossed.

            The coin may be any type as long as it has two distinct sides; it need not be a circulating coin as such. Larger coins tend to be more popular than smaller ones. Some high-profile coin tosses, such as the Cricket World Cup and the Super Bowl, use custom-made ceremonial medallions.

        <h2>Use in dispute resolution</h2>
        <p>
            Coin tossing is a simple and unbiased way of settling a dispute or deciding between two or more arbitrary options. In a game theoretic analysis it provides even odds to both sides involved, requiring little effort and preventing the dispute from escalating into a struggle. It is used widely in sports and other games to decide arbitrary factors such as which side of the field a team will play from, or which side will attack or defend initially; these decisions may tend to favor one side, or may be neutral. Factors such as wind direction, the position of the sun, and other conditions may affect the decision. In team sports it is often the captain who makes the call, while the umpire or referee usually oversees such proceedings. A competitive method may be used instead of a toss in some situations, for example in basketball the jump ball is employed, while the face-off plays a similar role in ice hockey.

            Coin flipping is used to decide which end of the field the teams will play to and/or which team gets first use of the ball, or similar questions in football matches, American football games, Australian rules football, volleyball, and other sports requiring such decisions. In the U.S. a specially minted coin is flipped in National Football League games; the coin is then sent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and other coins of the special series minted at the same time are sold to collectors. The original XFL, a short-lived American football league, attempted to avoid coin tosses by implementing a face-off style "opening scramble," in which one player from each team tried to recover a loose football; the team whose player recovered the ball got first choice. Because of the high rate of injury in these events, it has not achieved mainstream popularity in any football league (a modified version was adopted by X-League Indoor Football, in which each player pursued his own ball), and coin tossing remains the method of choice in American football. (The revived XFL, starting play in 2020, will forego the coin toss altogether and allow that decision to be made as part of a team's home field advantage.)
