        <h1>Music and its effects on Mental Health</h1>
        <h2>Overarching Question</h2>
        <p>
        How does music impact mental health?
        </p>
        <div>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            As studies have been conducted, it has been shown that music not only shapes individual and cultural identities, but also plays a strong role in mood regulation and improvement of mental health. As students, music plays a large role in our lives whether that’s for studying, being active, or hanging out with friends. With the rise of technology, it is especially easier to quantify one’s music statistics, meaning people can report exactly how often they listen to music or exactly what genres they are listening to. Some of our inspiration comes from Spotify Wrapped, a marketing campaign about individual user’s activity over the past year. Seeing how music habits differentiate from person to person motivated us to understand if those habits have any effect on mental health or something greater. We hope to take advantage of the increase in available music streaming data to know in what specific ways listening to music has helped us and what further steps people can take to maximize their potential benefit. To do this, we want to look at how variables such as hours spent listening to music, genres listened to, and context in which the music is listened to can improve disorders such as Anxiety, Depression, and more.

        <h2>Summary Visualizations</h2>
        <div>
        <p>
        Below are some figures summarizing our data set.
        </p>
        <img src="./heatmap.svg" class="img-centered">
        <div>
        <p>
        This heatmap demonstrates the correlations of the numerical variables, showing that the mental health illnesses are correlated.
        </p>
        <div>
        <p>
        This histogram reveals that people with high anxiety listen to slightly more music a day than people with medium and low anxiety. 
        </p>
        <div>
        <p>
        This histogram reveals the relations between the frequency that people listen to various music genres and insomnia.
        </p>
        <div>
        <h2>Visualizations</h2>
        <div>
        <p>
        The visualizations below dive into answering deeper, more specific questions. The first three visualizations are comparing 3 of the mental health illnesses to see if there any stark correlations, in order to understand if there is a specific mental health illness that we should hone in on.

            Anxiety and depression appear to have a positive linear relationship.
            We chose to focus and highlight more on anxiety for our project.

        <iframe src="./genre_boxplots.html" class="img-centered" width="2000" height="1200" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <p>
        This boxplot demonstrates the ranges of hours listened per day, for each genre. It helps answer the question of how each listener spends their time in the day, which may relate with a mental health illness.
        </p>
        <div>
        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        
        <p>
        Overall, we can see many small patterns between music and mental health. Some of the factors
        do not play a significant role, and we cannot see any extreme relationships between any factors,
        aside from the mental health correlations accross the other illnesses (like anxiety and depression).
        We can see that jazz and metal music have high ratings of insomnia, however, their hours per day range on the
        boxplot graph are not extremely skewed. Jazz has a slightly bigger distribution of hours per day listened, however, 
        both Rock and latin have a greater range of hours listened per day. The relation between genre frequency and 
        insomnia demonstrates that most "very frequently" listeners have higher ratings of insomnia. In conclusion,
        our data does not and will not label a genre or listening habit as "bad for your mental health". however, our
        visualizations demonstrate small relationships that could have the potential to effect people's mental health ratings.

        <h2>Use in dispute resolution</h2>
        <p>
            Coin tossing is a simple and unbiased way of settling a dispute or deciding between two or more arbitrary options. In a game theoretic analysis it provides even odds to both sides involved, requiring little effort and preventing the dispute from escalating into a struggle. It is used widely in sports and other games to decide arbitrary factors such as which side of the field a team will play from, or which side will attack or defend initially; these decisions may tend to favor one side, or may be neutral. Factors such as wind direction, the position of the sun, and other conditions may affect the decision. In team sports it is often the captain who makes the call, while the umpire or referee usually oversees such proceedings. A competitive method may be used instead of a toss in some situations, for example in basketball the jump ball is employed, while the face-off plays a similar role in ice hockey.

            Coin flipping is used to decide which end of the field the teams will play to and/or which team gets first use of the ball, or similar questions in football matches, American football games, Australian rules football, volleyball, and other sports requiring such decisions. In the U.S. a specially minted coin is flipped in National Football League games; the coin is then sent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and other coins of the special series minted at the same time are sold to collectors. The original XFL, a short-lived American football league, attempted to avoid coin tosses by implementing a face-off style "opening scramble," in which one player from each team tried to recover a loose football; the team whose player recovered the ball got first choice. Because of the high rate of injury in these events, it has not achieved mainstream popularity in any football league (a modified version was adopted by X-League Indoor Football, in which each player pursued his own ball), and coin tossing remains the method of choice in American football. (The revived XFL, starting play in 2020, will forego the coin toss altogether and allow that decision to be made as part of a team's home field advantage.)
